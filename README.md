This is my Work Day Scheduler jQuery that I created by using the HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and jQuery/JavaScript.
I added a screenshot of the Work Day Scheduler jQuery, and also i included a litle video that shows the functionality of the Scheduler.

## Technologies:

- HTML, Bootstrap I used them both to structure my web page.
- Bootstrap, CSS I used the Bootstrap and CSS to style my web page and give it some nice looking by adding colors.
- jQuery/JavaScript to add the functionality to the Scheduler.

## Editors:

- [Microsoft VS CODE:](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) it’s an awesome code editor.
- [Nodepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) it’s very helpful code editor that am using all the time plus it’s very light weight.
